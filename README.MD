Individuals select a specific **genre** they want to watch, and based on their selection, they will receive several different anime recommendations. 


Each anime recommendation comes in a card that details the title, image, synopsis, and a random quote from the anime. Users can click to flip over the cards to read the synopsis of that anime.
